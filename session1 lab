                CREATE DATABASE company_db; 
                \c company_db 

2. Create Tables 
Create table called departments with two columns.(Department ID and Department name) 

              CREATE TABLE departments (

              dept_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL 
              ); 

Create table called employees with employee ID, employee name, email and department ID 
(Includes a foreign key referencing departments and employee ID should be auto increment) 

              CREATE TABLE employees ( 
              emp_id int GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY, 
              emp_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, 
              email VARCHAR(100), 
              dept_id INT REFERENCES departments(dept_id) 
              ); 

3. Insert Data 
              INSERT INTO departments (dept_id, dept_name) 
              VALUES (1,'HR'), (2,'Finance'), (3,'IT');
